# Battery Usage Guide
below is a guide to general best-practices for working with LiPO batteries.

## Charging Schedule
Since it's a pain to charge/discharge the LiPO's all the time, following a charging schedule is a good idea. Since worksessions are on Saturday's, it may
be a good idea to charge both Friday morning, and then discharge both Monday evening. This ensures we don't have charged batteries stored for more than 4 days,
which is typically recommended to ensure a long battery life.

## General Tips
#### Do
- unplug the battery immediately if you hear popping, see bloating, smell burning, or see smoke
- keep the battery connectors/terminals away from metal objects as this can lead to a short circuit (and potentially a fire)
- check the internal resistance and voltage of LiPO's that have been stored away for more than six months
  -  For regular LiPos, the voltage of each cell should not be below 3V while the IR should not exceed the original value by over 80-90%

#### Do Not
- leave the battery plugged into the car when you aren't using it
	- battery will discharge and voltage will drop to a level below where you can safely charge it again
- short battery leads
- plug battery in backwards
- try to disassemble or alter a LiPo pack by yourself; if the inner foil is exposed to air, your LiPo may explode.
- keep sharp objects near your LiPos. A ruptured foil or wrapping can lead to a fire.
- immerse your LiPos in water

## Charging Steps
You will want to make sure you have some time, as someone needs to be around the battery for the entire time it charges
- if you need to step out, stop charging and unplug everything, then resume when you are back

**Steps:**
1. grab materials - battery, fire-proof bag, charger
2. plug charger into wall outlet, plug battery into charger, and place battery into fire-proof bag
3. set the battery type to LiPO, set the LiPO charge to balance, and set the charge rate to 4 Amps (6-8 Amps if only charging one battery, check this first though)
4. wait until charge progress bar is full (red dot's slowly light up until the green dot is lit up)
5. unplug battery from charger, and unplug charger from wall
6. proceed to the fun part of actually driving the car

#### General Notes:
- when uncertain, always charge the LiPO batteries at a rate of 1C. 1C just means to charge your battery at 1A for every 1000 mAh. So, for a 3000 mAh battery, you would charge at 3A, for a 5000 mAh battery, you would charge at 5A
- never charge the LiPO batteries while they are inside the RC car
- heat kills LiPos, the hotter a battery gets, the shorter the lifespan will be. Never charge a battery that is still warm after usage, and never use a battery that is still warm from charging
- always check the voltage of your LiPos before charging to ensure that they are at, or above the minimum safe starting voltage. If starting voltage is below recommended levels, then your LiPO was probably over-discharged or has experienced a failure and should NOT be charged
- if you notice your LiPO battery is swelling (puffing) while charging, stop immediately and dispose of it once it has cooled down

## Discharging Steps
You will absolutely want to make sure you have some time, it takes so long to discharge these bad boys
  - if you have to leave before the battery finishes discharging, let a lead know and just unplug the battery and the charger, and store the battery away on the shelf **inside** a fire-proof bag

**Steps:**
1. same process as charging except you are gonna put the LiPO charge to storage. I don't think charge rate can be set here, could be wrong though.
2. wait until done discharging

#### General Notes:
- main reasons to discharge LiPO's is for storage, or to test it's voltage/capacity
- if you store a LiPo battery fully charged, this will exponentially increase the internal resistance (IR) of your battery, rendering it highly inefficient which cuts into your run-times, as well as its overall cycle life
- if you store your LiPos below the manufacturerâ€™s suggested voltage, the internal makeup - anode (negative terminal) and liquid electrolyte - can get irreversibly damaged and your LiPo may never charge again
  - if you will not be using a LiPO for more than three days, put it into storage mode
