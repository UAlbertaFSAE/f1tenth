# Common

**NOTE:** the f1tenth_gym_ros package is the simulator environment built by the f1tenth organization. BIG thanks to them, here is the [link](https://github.com/f1tenth/f1tenth_gym_ros/tree/main) to the original repository. We hard forked in case we needed to make any changes to the environment

### What goes here?
The `common/` folder should contain any ROS packages that are common to all other packages (like custom messages), as well as things that are just general to the stack (like the simulator)
